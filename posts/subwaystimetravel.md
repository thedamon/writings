When you get on a subway your world stops. Scientists or at least men wearing lab coats or white coats or just sheets on their heads or whatever have concluded or precluded, possibly deluded… YOU’RE ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS! These scientists have determined that in the time you get onto a subway car and when you leave you are in a sort of state of splendid suspended animation.

In Munich at the metro they took a man having stepped onto the train and a man who looked very similar having stepped off of the train. They cut off the middle finger from the right and then left hands of the (very likely) the same person and upon counting they discovered as they had suspected that the man HAD NOT EVEN AGED A LICK.

The scientific “community” being as it is barely a community at all. Did you see how Professor Whosoever was just ghastly like always at the year-end biochemical? Of course you didn’t. But also of course the scientific “community” was immediately in arms about the Munich experiments. Any number of squabbles and bickers were registered but most paramount they said: how could you expect conclusive temporal marking from counting the rings of a severed middle finger? They demanded a new subject be found and the experiment be redone this time of course using the subject’s ring finger.

Peer review. Humph!!! More like smear review.

At any rate and I do mean to bore you, but all I mean to cliche is that TIME STOPS WHEN YOU ARE ON THE SUBWAY. I read in a book that this is what happens any time you travel through space at great speed so I suppose it can’t be surprising.

Have a good day, please.
