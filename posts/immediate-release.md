** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE **

Local cancer cell looks to ‟break the cycle” — through an avant garde dance performance cum devised improv theatre extravaganza.

The show is called ‟(Break/-uh-/The/=/Cycle/=)” or simply “U”. And it's a reflection on how engrained the status quo is, and what it would mean to be just a little less malignant. And what one cell being a little less malignant would mean for the cancer. And for the host.

‟Yeah, right? I wrote that. It's deep.” reflected the anaplastic carcinoma. ‟It's a really complex topic. But more than anything I hope this show will make cells stop and think about what their role within this cancer of ours is, and what it could be.”

‟We're so relentlessly divided these days, but we can all make the choice. You can. And you. And you. If we change our habits (change our habits) in little ways (ways), we can learn to live in harmony with our host, and ultimately (save) it.”

The drama is set within the bowel, a locale the carcinoma has deep personal experience with. ‟My family actually moved here from the bowels in the early 80s and built a new life for ourselves. I'm used to feeling a little out of place. I think that outsider's perspective has given me the right tools to really deeply meditate on the philosophical underpinnings of our cancerous meta-centre.”

‟After generations of denial, I think finally cells are realizing the trajectory we are on right now if we don't stop.”

The carcinoma is a graduate of the Mesotheliomic Schoole of Theatro and Movementum, and currently lives near Gallbladder with its 470,000 children.
