I am gonna tell you how to right a stone cold fucking classic thing instead of just another piece of schlock. Don't we have enough of schlocks everywhere?

First. The most important thing and I'm not even gonna leave it for last. Your thing has to be good. Like really good. Shitty things aren't classics. So here is the one thing to keep in mind all the time when you are righting: make it like extremely good. Do not half ass this. Do not do it bad. 

If your still not sure what to do reed on for some more tips.

Tip 2 characters. Your righting should have characters in it. Otherwise it's just like what? You might have heard that before but you heard it hear first. I personally prefer characters that are well rounded like Os and 0s and that weird sideways infinity fellow. and I hope to have written several classics by this point so I would listen to what I say.

Tip say something ok? Don't just sit there and wait for somebody else to say it. then you're just a follower. If it's already been said but your sure you have to say it again (sometimes that's a thing) recommend at least saying it in a different way. Like maybe a Edinborgian accent. That could totally be classic.

Here's a bonus tip that could push you over the edge: maybe the characters could say something back and forth. 

There! Sorry this was so stupid but good job you probably have a classic now. I knew you had it in you!
