** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE **

*Local cancer cell looks to ‟break the cycle of destruction” — through an avant garde dance performance cum devised improv theatre extravaganza.*

The show is called *‟(Break/-uh-/The/=/Cycle/=)”* or stylized simply as *“U”*. It's a reflection on how engrained the status quo is within each of us, and what it could mean to be just a little less malignant.

‟Yeah, right? I wrote that. It's deep.” reflected the anaplastic carcinoma. ‟It's a really complex topic. But more than anything I hope this show will open up cells' membranes to the unavoidable consequences of the trajectory we're on right now.”

The performance is a generative exploration that frustrates conventional description. It combines dance and mime-punk, with weirdly sexualized cold sweats. The off-putting choreographed movements of the troupe will certainly leave audiences with a lot to think about.

The drama is set within the bowel, a locale the carcinoma has deep personal experience with. ‟My family actually moved here from the bowels in the early 80s and built a new life for ourselves. I'm used to feeling a little out of place. I think that outsider's perspective has given me the right tools to really deeply meditate on the philosophical underpinnings of our cancerous meta-centre.”

The artists hope that their performance will challenge the notion of growth for the growth's sake. ‟We're so relentlessly dividing these days, but maybe we can learn to live in harmony with our host. I know he kind of sucks, but think about if we're maybe a little bit fucked without him?”

The carcinoma is a graduate of the Mesotheliomic Schoole of Theatro and Movementum, and currently lives near Gallbladder with its 470,000 children.

It is just now putting the finishing touches on plans for a full-body tour of the show this Spring.

Tickets go on sale tomorrow.
