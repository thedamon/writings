It’s time. 50, 57 on the hour.

Nothing but smooth sailing isn’t that right, Ken?

Here’s your traffic report, Ken. 

It’s pitch black and you’re maybe 54 miles outside Cleveland by now. You should be at least that close, you’ve been making good time but—

It’s usually quiet this time of night, but still! Usually there’s the odd headlight or a taillight coming or going to make sense of. You haven’t seen another car in miles. 

Can’t really see anything at all except the engine light (You are checking it), the Gas tank warning light (it is low) and the highway lines passing us by (holding solid on the right, breaking rhythm on the left).

You’re listing. yawing. The tires and the wheel-well rubbing their treads together, making a deep thrum. Like a mess of monks, chanting in a cave in the woods, doing their summoning.

You’re barely awake. Blinking longer, every time. And after each blink, each eye-lid needs a full construction crew to reopen. Chains and cranes and bulldozers and everything. Once they’ve winched the lid up by the lashes, like a portcullis. It dangles there for a moment in the breeze, letting a little bit of whatever light there is in—the engine light, gas tank, highway lines—then it crashes back down.

Traffic? Traffic is good. Miles and miles of open road. Beside the road don’t even ask. It just drops away. Sometimes there’s a gravel shoulder, but mostly it just drops away. There’s nothing out there. Only theories. Theoretically there’s cornfields. Theoretically there’s a lake. But that’s not traffic. This is your traffic report.

You’re ready for a new feature. Anything. The glow of a factory over to the right. Or an overpass to to pass under. Or a lane merge to avoid. Or another car. Or exit 54.

You should have passed Sandusky by now, right? 

The night feels thicker. Probably another fog rolled off side of the lake. But something else, too, like the sky is blacked out and lowering on top of the car. You can still fit under it at least for now, so we keep driving.

A yawn comes. And this one might be *that* yawn. The one that opens up and draws in, but keeps going and never ends, never resolves. Your mouth opening wider and wider. The blood pumping in your ears. Rushing like Niagara Falls. Your vision blurring. Reconstituting. Then blurring more. Your heart pounding. The air still pouring into you. Yet you’re still yawning.

The engine light, the gas gauge and the highway lines are brighter than the sun. Everything else is black.

You should have no trouble getting where you’re going tonight if you can stay awake.

Back to you, Ken.
