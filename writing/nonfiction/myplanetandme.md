A play I wrote to perform in the 2017 London Fringe festival based on what might happen if a sentient planet made psychic first contact with a fairly normal person.

I thought this was a fun spin on the 'air my emotional laundry' brand of one person show, presented as purely factual but veering wholeheartedly into science fiction.

This was an idea I'd kicked around for a while and suddenly had to put into reality when my ticket came up at the London Fringe Festival. Cara heard about my show and asked if she could stage manage, and my dear friend Kristin came on to direct, together we called ourselfs Emergent Seas (a name I'd previously given to [a primordial sounding mix cd](https://www.mixcloud.com/radioslipstream/sailing-emergent-seas/))

In my production I wanted the 'one person' to be overshadowed by local collaborators and to that end worked with musicians to create an original score, a poster artist, voice over actors, a film director to shoot [a trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYFZSF-NJiM), and more.

"Planet" was performed twice:

First, at the 2017 London Fringe Festival,
featuring original music by Wormwood ([more info](https://www.emergentseas.co/my-planet-fringe)), and solo dance by myself (with consultation by Hannah Goldberg) â€” thus making it a sci fi musical.

It was remounted in January 2018 at the Aeolian Hall in collaboration with multidisciplinary artists, featuring an improvised modular synth/theremin soundtrack by Timothy Glasgow, interpretive dance by Public Displays of Art, and morphing light sculptures by Matthew Trueman (who contributed a blinky planet light to the Fringe production).

That show was performed one night only and the performance was our dress rehearsal too, having only had time for a rough Cue-to-cue run through beforehand. It was all very "live", which is a great thing for theatre to be.

In the years following those performances, the themes/concepts and some aspects I wasn't totally pleased with from the writing point of view continue to swirl in the creative part of my brain. As a result, there are a few callback compositions here, or 'reversions' of scenes/ideas that were in the original play. If these are "for" anything other than themselves remains to be seen.
