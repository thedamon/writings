# My Planet and Me

*My Planet and Me* is a one-person play I wrote for and performed at the 2017 London Fringe Festival. It examines what might happen if a sentient planet made psychic first contact with a fairly normal person. [More info about the play](/myplanetandme).

On this site are a few scenes from the show, and some exploratory revisitations of its moments and/or themes.
