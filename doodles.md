Generative AI is the manifestation of a culture’s collective unconscious. That’s what makes it so dangerous. 

---

There’s too many things for your thing or another thing to really be very interesting to be worth the attention let alone worth the effort of creation. And so you do anyway? AI could have done it better, faster, cheaper.

---

AI: 
Good, fast, cheap
You can only have three.
Just don’t look too close. 
Good thing nobody has time to look close anymore.

What am I for?

Curiosity used to be a superpower. Now answers overthrong any and every question, falling upon any glint of a beginning of a fruitful line of inquiry and pummeling it into the ground. Roiling over and over; eddies casting you in circles and spatters. You will surely be lost. Curiosity is now a liability. Exactly the sort of thing you ought to leave home without.

What do I have to do to keep you interested?

---

A pair of leaf husks, who’ve given up all their color and softness. Now crispy and flaking like rust. Scrattling down the street in the low drone salmon smear of the street lights. Their dessicate edges scrape the asphalt; their gait like injury or reanimation. Zombie-like. Two lone sentries, scouts for the impending horde.

Synergy is a word you make up because you forgot to look outside and see how everything already works. Nature, while it survives, is balance; otherwise we’d be gone (our current project, apparently). 

Synergy? Look outside. Brace to each yaw. The ripple of every weight creating a counterbalance. Evolving — not engineering. Evolving is turning inward. Revolving and coalescing into a whole. Finding and becoming what already works and will always work. Engineering is accelerating somewhere too fast to consider the implications.

Coreless wonder. 
Artless blunder. 
Drip toward the afterword. 
Freeze the goosebumps where they stay.

It doesn’t happen often, but sometimes you find a thing and it’s just what it is, not too much more.

Is what it is.

Rare these days innit? For a thing to be itself?

Easier, though. Less... slippery.

Sometimes do you read the name of a city and just have your brain stutter to a stop and open wide to try and let in the possibility of what it’d be like to have lived there? To have grown up in different streets and backyards. To recognize different stores and fields and buildings. To not realize that that certain assumptions and verbal ticks are grown out of that city. Every city or town, even the ones just an hour down the road is a vast bed of possibility and experience. Smoky dive bars. 

---

Wet cling in the chill cut air. Dolorous tap dancing through the paper thin puddles, each one tinkle yelping at your boots. Just a little meep as you pass. 

7/13ths of a block is the right amount of territory to stake claim; a set of sidewalk sections that seems manageable. Don’t go too far, just back and forth like a lolling wobble.
